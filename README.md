# Canvas Knights Tour
Canvas interactive animated knight's tour.
Click on a square to start a tour. Click again to cancel it.

### Install
Within terminal `cd` to the parent directory `PATH-TO/canvas-knights-tour` and type `npm install`.
Once complete, type `npm start` and go to `http://localhost:3030` in a browser.

Note: I did this for fun a while back, and by no means is it optimized or written well. This project was simply a challenge for myself to create a knight's tour. Also, there's no backtracking, so A5 and H5 error.

I've decided to make this public for anyone to hack away at it.
